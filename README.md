# Diversity-and-Inclusion-Dashboard-Project

## Description:
For the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, I conducted an analysis of an HR Diversity and Inclusion dataset, creating a Power BI dashboard report and establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge the organization's progress. This project aimed to foster data-driven decision-making and provide actionable insights towards enhancing diversity and inclusion initiatives within the organization.

## Project Details:

In this HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis project, I developed a Power BI dashboard report and devised measures to define pertinent KPIs for monitoring and assessing the organization's diversity efforts. By analyzing demographic characteristics like gender, age, and nationality, I computed essential metrics to gain insights into the organization's diversity and inclusion endeavors.

To initiate the analysis, I calculated the diversity ratio, comparing the number of female employees to the total workforce. Subsequently, I formulated KPIs to track the composition of male and female employees, turnover rates, promotions, and new hires within the organization. These KPIs included metrics such as Diversity Percentage for Females, Percentage of Turnover, and Average Performance Ratings for both genders.

The resulting dashboard report offered a comprehensive overview of the organization's diversity and inclusion landscape, highlighting areas of strength and areas requiring attention or improvement.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

KPIs are pivotal metrics used to evaluate organizational performance and progress towards specific objectives. Some of the KPIs calculated for this project include:

Diversity Percentage for Females
Number of Male and Female Employees
Number of Leavers
Percentage of Employees Promoted in FY20
Percentage of Women and Men Promoted
Percentage of Male and Female New Hires
Percentage Turnover in FY20
Average Performance Rating of Men and Women
Turnover Definition:
Turnover refers to the rate at which employees leave an organization within a specified period. There are various types of turnover, including voluntary, involuntary, and functional turnover. High turnover can incur costs and disrupt operations, while low turnover can indicate employee satisfaction and stability within the organization.

## Data Collection:

The dataset, provided by PwC from the Human Resources department of a telecom client during the Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience, contained records of 500 employees, encompassing fields such as Employee ID, Gender, Age Group, Job Level, Performance Ratings, and more.

## Skills Utilized:

The project involved several data-related tasks, including cleaning, inspection, transformation, standardization, and visualization. Tools such as Microsoft Excel, Power Query, DAX, and Microsoft Power BI were employed to manipulate and analyze the data effectively.

## Insights & Recommendations:
Analysis of the data revealed insights such as gender disparities in senior management, high turnover rates, and department-specific challenges. Recommendations included initiatives to address bias in recruitment and promotion, provide training opportunities for women, improve employee engagement, and investigate the underlying causes of turnover.

This project served as a valuable tool for HR managers to evaluate progress towards diversity and inclusion goals, offering actionable insights for continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

The HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis project offered vital insights into the organization's diversity landscape, paving the way for informed decision-making and strategic planning. By establishing key performance indicators (KPIs) and crafting a Power BI dashboard report, the project facilitated a clear understanding of diversity metrics and identified areas ripe for improvement.

Critical findings, including gender imbalances in senior roles and high turnover rates, underscored the need for targeted interventions to promote inclusivity and retention. Recommendations emphasized proactive measures such as bias mitigation in recruitment, tailored training initiatives, and enhanced employee engagement strategies.
